With this small installable app you can browse random comic strips from sources like Garfield, XKCD, Calvin and Hobbes and Dilbert

Please create your own proxy on heroku to mitigate no-cors issue 

It also uses 'Github Actions' to continuously integrate and deploy to github pages

you can see it live here: <br/>
